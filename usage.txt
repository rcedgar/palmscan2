3D search:
    palmscan2 -search3d INPUT -tsv hits.tsv

Convert PDB to CAL format:
    palmscan2 -pdb2cal INPUT -cal chains.cal

INPUT:
    (1) PDB format file with one or more chains
    (2) CAL format file with one or more chains
    (3) Text file with one PDB or CAL pathname per line

Options:
    -tsv hits.tsv   Tab-separated file with hits
    -misses         Include non-matches in tsv (default hits only)
    -pml hits.pml   Pymol script to annotate chain(s)
    -pml_save       Include save commands in pml script to generate
                      one pse for each input chain.
    -loaddir DIR    Directory where pdb files are stored so that
                      load commands in pml scripts work as-is
    -searchmfs      Motifs to report in tsv/pml (default *)
    -requiremfs     Required motifs to report hits (default ABC)
    -minppscore     Minimum palmprint score 0..1 (default 0.5)
    -minpalmscore   Minimum palm domain score 0..1 (default 0.69)
    -minselfscorepp     Minimum ABC motif self-score (default 0.5)
    -minselfscorenonpp  Minimum non-ABC self-score (default 0.5)

Motifs
    F1, F2, H, J, A, B, C and D are modeled.
    The -searchmfs and -requiremfs options specify which
    motifs should be searched and which should be required
    to report a hit, respectively. ABC must be included.
    If you only care about the hits and not the annotations,
    then -searchmfs ABC may give a small gain in speed.
    Star (*) is shorthand for all motifs, e.g. -searchmfs *.

CAL format:
    Sequence and C-alpha coordinates only.
    More compact than PDB for faster search.
    Use pdb2cal command to convert PDB to CAL.
